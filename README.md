# High-Level Design of 2D-Convolution Accelerators with HLS and ESP
Designing accelerators that perform a specific type of convolution known as 2D convolution. 
The design process leverages C++ High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and the Embedded Scalable Platform (ESP) tool, which simplifies accelerators design and their integration into heterogeneous System-On-Chips (SoCs).
